## Problem Description

While many factors influence future occupation trends, wages remain one of the most critical considerations for industry choice. This project aims to predict future hourly and annual wages for specific occupations across different industries based on historical wage data, which could be particularly valuable for professionals looking to transition to a different industry or soon-to-be graduates deciding on their career paths.

### Project Goal:

Identify the industries that will likely offer the highest wages in the future.

### Problem Scope:

The project will explore the relationships between industry type, occupation, and wages, while weighing factors such as: 
- Total Industry Employment
- Geographical area
- Percent of total industry employment represented by the occupation
- Educational background
- External factors (e.g. weather)

### Data Sources:

- **Industry Wage Data:** Historical wage information from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm )
- **Education Data:** Sourced from the [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) to analyze how educational attainment affects wages.
- **Weather Data:** Sourced from the [National Climate Data Center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) to assess the impact of seasonal variations on wages.
